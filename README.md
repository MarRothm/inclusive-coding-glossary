# inclusive-coding-glossary
IT Glossary for free of racist and discriminatory terms. Collaboration and discussion is highly recommended.

There are some terms in IT which have a racist history, e.g. "master/slave", or "blacklist". However, many of us haven't been aware of that, because we've always used those terms without thinking much about them. 
The current wave of protests against racism and discrimination also brought (again) some focus on this fact as well.
